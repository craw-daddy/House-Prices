A brief web application to attempt to demonstrate the use of Flask to give predictions from a pre-created model.  Deployed to render.com.

The website can be found here: https://house-price-prediction-rd1t.onrender.com/

See https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/overview for more details the data used to create this model.  You will also need to download the data from that website as the data isn't hosted here.
